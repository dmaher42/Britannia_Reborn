# Project: Britannia Reborn

A modern, browser‑based reimagining of classic Britannia with an AI‑driven narrative.

## Quick Start
- Open `app/index.html` directly in your browser for the full ES‑modules demo (no server required).
- Or open `demo.html` and click “Launch the Game”.
## GitHub Pages
Enable Pages for the repo root so `demo.html` works; it links to `app/index.html`.

## Using Codex
- Connect your GitHub to Codex in ChatGPT.
- Open an issue and tag **@codex** with a task (e.g., “Implement equipment slots and tests”).

See **AGENTS.md** for the roadmap.
