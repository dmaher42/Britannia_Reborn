# Project: Britannia Reborn

A modern, browser‑based reimagining of classic Britannia with an AI‑driven narrative.

## Quick Start
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser (or the GitHub Pages URL).
- Click the game once to focus (if needed), then use WASD/Arrow keys to move immediately.
## Troubleshooting
If movement does not work (blank or stuck):
- Ensure the game canvas is focused (click once if needed).
- Check for blocked key listeners (should be attached to window).
- Exiting combat/skirmish should re-enable movement.

## Using Codex
- Connect your GitHub to Codex in ChatGPT.
- Open an issue and tag **@codex** with a task (e.g., “Implement equipment slots and tests”).

See **AGENTS.md** for the roadmap.
