# Art placeholders

Binary sprite sheets are not committed. Add your artwork here with the following filenames so the renderer can find them:

- `characters.png`
- `monsters.png`
- `items.png`
- `tiles.png`
- `effects.png`
- `ui.png`

Sprites should be 32×32 pixels and designed for 2× scaling in-game. Missing files trigger console warnings but do not break the app.
